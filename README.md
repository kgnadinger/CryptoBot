You will need to set up a Secrets class in the main folder in secrets.rb.

The class should define 4 class methods: api_key and secret_key from binance, along with database_username and database_password.

Create a mysql database called binance with a table called vens that has a closing_price, closing_time, updated_at and created_at fields.
